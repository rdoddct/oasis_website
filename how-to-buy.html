          <p class="faq-content">As per the UAE guidelines, the insurer of your vehicle is required to notify the loss to TP’s insurance carrier if the estimate repair cost exceeds a pre-set amount (AED 5,000). It will take three working days for the TP’s insurer to inspect the vehicle and agree on the repair cost with the repairer. This is required to recover the expenses incurred for repairing the vehicle from the TP’s insurer and to maintain your No Claim Discount (NCD) as earlier.<a href="#"><br></a></p>
